### ImpactHack -- Data Visualization project with R Leaflet

This repository contains open source data regarding about 30,000 power plants around the world, their elevation, SPEI score, water stress
level, etc. My team of 4 members at ImpactHack wanted to visualize the data and provide some insights on the risks of investment for these
power plants. We decided to use R Leaflet to plot goelogical data and R Shiny to present it on a webpage. I was able to categorize the 
power plants into renewable and nonrenwable power plants and plot them against each other. With regards to sea level and drought, I 
color-coded the power plants based on their elevation and their SPEI levels repectively. Both of the factors are main risks for investment
in a power plant. We think it would be helpful to run some analysis, such as regression, PCA, K-means and so on to obtain more information
from the data.
